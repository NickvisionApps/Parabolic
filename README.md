## Building Manually
Parabolic uses `cmake` as its build system and `vcpkg` to *optionally* manage its dependencies.

Ensure `cmake` and `vcpkg` are installed on your system before building and installing Parabolic.

A C++20 compiler is also required to build Parabolic.

### Dependencies
The following are a list of dependencies used by Parabolic.

The recommendation is to (and below commands will) use vcpkg to pull these dependencies. However, vcpkg is not a requirement as long as the system provides these dependencies correctly.

#### All Platforms
- `libnick`
- `boost-date-time`

#### Linux
- `blueprint-compiler` (Not available from vcpkg)
- `libxmlpp`

### Configuring vcpkg
1. Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to the path of your vcpkg installation's root directory.
#### Windows
1. Set the `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` environment variable to `x64-windows`
1. Run `vcpkg install libnick boost-date-time`
#### Linux
1. Set the `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` environment variable to `x64-linux`
1. Run `vcpkg install libnick libxmlpp boost-date-time`

### Building
1. First, clone/download the repo.
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repo's root directory.
1. Create a new `build` directory and `cd` into it.
#### Windows
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"`.
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake --build . --config Release`.
1. After these commands complete, Parabolic will be successfully built and its binaries can be found in the `org.nickvision.tubeconverter.winui/Release` folder of the `build` folder.
#### Windows (Portable)
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DBUILD_AS_PORTABLE=ON`.
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake --build . --config Release`.
1. After these commands complete, Application will be successfully built and its binaries can be found in the `org.nickvision.application.winui/Release` folder of the `build` folder.
#### Linux
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
1. From the `build` folder, run `cmake --build .`.
1. After these commands complete, Parabolic will be successfully built and its binaries can be found in the `org.nickvision.tubeconverter.gnome` folder of the `build` folder.
